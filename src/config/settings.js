/**
 * settings.js — the single source of truth for every tweakable value in the sandbox.
 *
 * Nothing in the renderer owns state that lives here: shaders, particle systems,
 * lights and post processing all *read* these objects every frame. That is what
 * makes the real-time editor work without rebuilding anything — mutating a field
 * is immediately visible on screen, including on an ice field that is already
 * standing, and including while the clock is paused (`P`), which is when the
 * shapes are actually worth tuning.
 *
 * The one rule that keeps that promise: a system may only ever *sample* these
 * values. It must never copy one into a record at spawn time and read it back
 * later — see `IceAbility`, whose spike records hold nothing but unitless dice
 * rolls, and resolve every metre, radian and second against this file each frame.
 *
 * Conventions
 *  - Colours are stored as `#rrggbb` strings so lil-gui can bind them directly.
 *    Use `utils/color.js#getColor()` to read them as a cached THREE.Color.
 *  - `global` holds multipliers that scale everything at once (1 = neutral).
 *  - The per-ability blocks (`ice`, `thunder`, `meteor`, `beam`) hold absolute values.
 *
 * Every ability block is keyed by its id in `ELEMENTS`, and the shared systems
 * that need to know about "the ability the player is currently holding" — the
 * aim controller, the cooldown, the HUD — look it up as `settings[element]`.
 * The four fields they rely on being present are `range`, `minRange`, `speed`
 * and `cooldown`; everything else in a block is that ability's own business.
 * A **far cast** (`CastShape.ZONE`, declared in `ELEMENT_META`) adds a fifth:
 * `zoneRadius`, the footprint the circle indicator measures out.
 *
 * Six blocks are written out longhand, in `blocks-strikes.js`,
 * `blocks-projectiles.js` and `blocks-farcasts.js`, and spread back into the
 * position they were written at. The other seventy-four are derived from them in
 * `config/variants.js` and the twelve `signatures-*.js` modules and spliced in
 * further down — same shape, same editor, same preset system, no runtime
 * indirection. The registry that names and groups all eighty lives in
 * `config/registry.js` and is re-exported from here, so every existing
 * `import … from 'config/settings.js'` still resolves.
